Topics in OOPS:
- Class
- Object
- Abstraction
- Incapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance


Class:
Class is a blueprint
Object is an instance of the class

Types of class:
built-in
user defined

Constructor:
- Special function
- self call (the moment you create an object of the class)

- Functions inside a class is called method (thou they are functions only but we cll them method)

Magic Method/Dunder Method =======
Identification = __<name>__

-- All the configuration related code we write inside Constructor, any piece of code you don't want give control to the user
-- Self is nothing but the current object

Fraction Class =======
__str__ => tells how output should look like (__str__ magic method)

-- __add__ = auto executes, if it finds any + operator in code

Reference Variable =======
holds the memory of the location of the object, and not the actual object
